* Designed interface that sales representatives in a bank/credit card company can use to decide on accepting or rejecting applications
* Developed a predictive model to assess credit risk
* Trained and evaluated model performance

## Data Profiles
* Our interface included integration and analytics. 
* The interface allows new users to begin effective interaction and could easily achieve maximal performance.
* There are a total of 23 features in the dataset.
* We choose the Boosting Model to make predictions.

## Insights
* A higher score indicates that the specific feature will have a larger effect on the model.
* the prediction results of whether the client's application should be "Reject" or "Accept" are shown at the bottom of the interface's input.
